When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository if I was using multiple computers or working with another user.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This will allow a user to decider which files a user would like to have on GitHub.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks create a copy of a repository only on GitHub. Clones create a copy of a repository from GitHub to local machines or local to local machines. A branch creates a copy of a file path and allows a user to create another path that branches away from the master branch.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows a user to work offline of the most up-to-date file.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would just update the file and save it as a new name. I would then work on the chronologically most recent file. Git would be MUCH easier to work on and keep track of all of the changes.
